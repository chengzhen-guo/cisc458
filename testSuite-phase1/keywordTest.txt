Purpose:
1. All added Like keywords and predefined identifiers can be emitted properly.
2. The old PT keywords and identifiers are emitted as regular pIdentifier token text.

Result:
In the expected output. Like keywords,for example 'elseIf', can be emitted as 'pElseif' token. Like predefined identifiers,for instance 'put', can be scanned as token texts 'put' for future parsing.
For those old keywords and predefined identifiers for the old PT, they will be emitted as regular pIdentifiers with token text.
In the actual output, which you can find in .eOutput file, the new added keywords are recognized as keywords, and are correctly screened to their tokens.
The removed PT keyword e.g. 'array' is now recognized as a text. This shows the keywords removal&addition was successful.
