This test folder contains two tests: including constant-integer.pt and constant-types.pt. Here are their corresponding purposes and results respectively. 

 

1. constant-integer.pt 

Purpose: 

Test if a single integer assignment and multiple integer assignments (separated by commas) are generated correct output sequence. 

Result: 

No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected. oTypeStkPush(tpInteger) is generated. 

 

2. constant-types.pt 

Purpose: 

Test if multiple different types of assignments (separated by commas) are generated correct output sequence. 

Result: 

No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected. oTypeStkPush(tpInteger) and  

oTypeStkPush(tpChar) are generated.
