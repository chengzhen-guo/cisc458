This test folder contains four tests: including ‘routine.pt’, ‘parameter.pt’. 

1. routine.pt 

Purpose: 

To test if a procedure (function) is defined with tokens tSkipProc and tProcedureEnd included. 

Result: 

In the output, there was tSkipProc and tProcedureEnd tokens emitted. In the @ProcedureHeading, there is no variable/constant definition because there is no parameter in function F. 

 

2. Parameter.pt 

Purpose: 

To test if parameters inside a function declaration can be identified. 

Result: 

In the output, two sIdentifier tokens that were emitted in the second phase are captured inside @ProcedureHeading and then were pushed into Symbol Table.
