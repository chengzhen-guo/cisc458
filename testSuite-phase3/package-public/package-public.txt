This test folder contains four tests: including ‘package.pt’, ‘public-publicfun.pt’, ‘public-publicval.pt’ and ‘public-publicvar.pt’. 

1. package.pt 

Purpose: 

To test if the declaration of a package can be identified in the ‘Like’ program specification. 

Result: 

The package’s symbol syPackage is pushed to the symbol table. 

 

2. public-publicfun.pt 

Purpose: 

To test if Like routines (functions) that are declared as public can be referenced outside the package. 

Result: 

In the output, there was one oSymbolStkSetPublicFlag in the first ProcedureDefiniton for function F1 and non-public function F2. An error token #eUndefinedIdentifier was emitted when call function F2 outside the package. 

 

3. public-publicval.pt 

Purpose: 

To test if Like constants that are declared as public can be referenced 

Result: 

In the output, there was one oSymbolStkSetPublicFlag in the first constantDefinition for two constant declarations x and y. An error token #eUndefinedIdentifier was emitted when reference the local constant y outside of the package. 

 

4. public-publicvar.pt 

Purpose: 

To test if Like variables that are declared as public can be referenced 

Result: 

In the output, there was one oSymbolStkSetPublicFlag in the first variableDeclarations for two variable declarations x and y. An error token #eUndefinedIdentifier was emitted when reference the local constant y outside of the package.
