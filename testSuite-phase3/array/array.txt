This test folder contains five tests: including array_boolean.pt, array_identifier.pt, array_integer.pt, array_nEle_val.pt, array_string.pt. Here are their corresponding purposes and results respectively. 

 

1. array_boolean.pt 

Purpose: 

Test if Boolean type can be put into array. 

Result: 

No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected. OTypeStkChooseKind (tpBoolean) is generated. 
 

2. array_identifier.pt 

Purpose: 

Test if constant identifiers are accepted by array. (e.g, like x)  

Result: 

No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected. ProgramParameter, is called and then oSymbolStkPushLocalIdentifier is emitted. Also, oTypeStkChooseKind (tpInteger) is generated. 

 

3. array_integer.pt 

Purpose: 

Test if array can accept integer. (e.g, like 1) 

Result: 

No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected.  

 

4. array_nEle_val.pt 

Purpose: 

Test if predefined array size is accepted when initializing the array. 

Result: 

No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected. oTypeStkChooseKind (tpInteger) is generated. 

 

5. array_string.pt 

Purpose: 

Test if array can accept string. (e.g, like “Hello”) 

Result: 

No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected. oTypeStkChooseKind (tpChar) is generated.
