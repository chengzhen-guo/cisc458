Purpose: 

Test if the choose statement with the optional else in Like will output the same token stream as the PT Pascal for the parts before the else alternative, and a sCaseElse token followed by the statement inside of the else (with sBigin and sEnd tokens). 

Result: 

The output matches the expected output.
