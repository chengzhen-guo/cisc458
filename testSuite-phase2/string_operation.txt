Purpose: 

Test if new Like string operations: Concatenation, Repeat String, Substring, and Length can be parsed to emit corresponding semantic tokens. 

Result: 

The output matches the expected result, with a general form of: 

.sAssignmentStmt 

.sIdentifer   % corresponds to ‘i =’ 

< Related operation token > 

.sExpnEnd 

In the <Related operation token> various number of sStringLiteral tokens and sInteger tokens were emitted according to the instruction, 
followed by a corresponding semantic token (sConcatenate, sRepeatString, sSubstring, sLength). In Concatenate (s | s), two sStringLiteral tokens were emitted;
In Repeat String ( s || n), one sStringLiteral token and one sInteger token were emitted; In Substring, one sStringLiteral token and two sInteger tokens were emitted;
In Length, only a StringLiteral token was emitted.
