Results: in this phase results are written accumulatively becuase the results are essentially the outputs of programs. However, since all unit tests here do not have put/putln, there
is nothing printed out on screen. Therefore, it should work as expected (under this folder) if we can compile and run them without any error. All unit tests were compiled and
executed successfully.
