This test folder contains four tests: including init-bool.pt, init-exp.pt, init-identifier.pt, and init-int.pt. Here are their corresponding purposes and results respectively.
1. init-bool.pt
Purpose:
Test if Boolean type initialization can work properly.
Result:
No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected. @OperandAssignBooleanPopPop is called as expected.
2. init-exp.pt
Purpose:
Test if expression initialization can work properly.
Result:
No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected. 
3. init-identifier.pt 
Purpose:
Test if a variable can be initialized with a defined variable.
Result:
No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected.
4. init-int.pt.
Purpose:
Test if a variable can be initialized with an integer.
Result:
No errors are detected. The output sequence is matched as expected.
